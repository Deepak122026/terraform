 Benefits of Multi-Region EC2 Deployment
 
1. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
If one AWS region goes down, your application can remain available in another region.

Example: Deploying EC2 instances in us-east-1 and us-west-2 ensures that an outage in the US East doesn’t take down your service completely.

2. Disaster Recovery
Multi-region setups help you implement DR strategies, such as:

Active-passive: Primary in one region, standby in another.

Active-active: Both regions handle traffic (with load balancing or DNS-based routing).

3. Improved Latency
Users in different geographic locations can be served by instances closer to them.

Example: EC2 in us-east-1 for US East Coast users, and ap-southeast-1 for Southeast Asia.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}



# EC2 in us-east-1
resource "aws_instance" "east_instance" {
  provider      = aws.us_east
  ami           = "ami-12344"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "EastInstance"
  }
}

# EC2 in us-west-2
resource "aws_instance" "west_instance" {
  provider      = aws.us_west
  ami           = "ami-1234"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WestInstance"
  }
}
